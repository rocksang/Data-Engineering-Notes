What is Docker?
	•	Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to run applications in isolated environments called containers.
	•	Think of it as a lightweight virtual machine.
	•	Each service (e.g., Postgres, pgAdmin) runs in its own container.


What is pgAdmin?
	•	pgAdmin is a web-based GUI tool for managing PostgreSQL databases.
	•	It allows you to browse tables, run SQL queries, and inspect data visually.

How They Work Together
	•	PostgreSQL is your actual database engine.
	•	pgAdmin connects to PostgreSQL to let you manage the DB with a graphical interface.
	•	Docker runs both PostgreSQL and pgAdmin in isolated containers, making setup consistent and portable.

Typical flow:
Docker → runs containers for → PostgreSQL (DB) + pgAdmin (UI)
pgAdmin → connects to → PostgreSQL (via host, port, user, password)

ETL with Python + SQLAlchemy + Pandas:

from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd

# Connect to Postgres DB
engine = create_engine('postgresql://root:root@localhost:5432/ny_taxi')

# Read CSV and write to DB
df = pd.read_csv('yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv')
df.to_sql(name='yellow_taxi_trips', con=engine, if_exists='replace')
